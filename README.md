# alphazero-simple

This repository contains an implementation of the AlphaZero algorithm, inspired by the original work from the following GitHub repository:

- [AlphaZero-General](https://github.com/suragnair/alpha-zero-general)

## Overview

AlphaZero is a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithm developed by DeepMind. It combines deep neural networks with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to achieve superhuman performance in board games like Gomoku. The algorithm learns purely from self-play, without any prior knowledge or human data.

This repository provides a general implementation of AlphaZero that can be applied to different board games, with the ability to train, evaluate, and test models.
